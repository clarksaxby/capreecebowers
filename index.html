          To all of my valued clients:
        </p>
        <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving globally and remains a public health concern. The safety of our
          clients and families is our highest priority. As a result, we are recommending telehealth appointments as much
          as possible, but I am offering some limited face to face sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are following the guidelines of our Public Health officials and will continually evaluate the
          recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be well and take good care of yourselves during this challenging time.

          <h2>About My Practice</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          My name is Capreece and I am part of the Shuswap Clinical Counselling Centre. I am a down-to-earth mental
          health professional based out of Salmon Arm. My practice has focused on instilling hope in clients who
          experience mental health challenges related to stressful life experiences. I embrace a client-centered
          counselling approach which means that I listen to the client with curiosity and an open heart. I also embrace
          a wide range of therapeutic approaches to ensure I don’t try to fit you into a prescribed box. In Salmon Arm,
          I am embedded in the community fabric, being a registered service provider with the Crime Victim Assistance
          Program, the WorkSafe Critical Incident Response Program and the BC Emergency Health Program, and First
          Responder Health. I am also proud to be working alongside the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Association. I am
          also involved in my community as a licenced funeral director and funeral celebrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we experience grief, loss, trauma or stress in our lives, it is
          normal for things to unravel. My passion is helping people who have
          experienced a traumatic/stressful experience, those who are
          grieving, and those who are impacted by mental health challenges or
          disorders. Many people find that talking with a safe, confidential
          person, who can listen in a non-judgmental manner can be very
          beneficial. My clients are children, adolescents, adults and
          families.

              evidence-based treatment services that build on the strength and resiliency of any client – from police

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Salmon Arm, and I grew up helping out in my
          family’s funeral home. My experience at the funeral home influenced
          me to pursue a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Psychology. I have
          stayed active at
          <a href="http://www.bowersfuneralservice.com">Bowers Funeral Home</a>
          as a licenced funeral director and a certified funeral celebrant.
          Grief and loss has always been a part of life that I have been drawn
          to learn more about, as grief underlies so many aspects of the
          challenges we face.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am happy to be back in my hometown raising two teenagers with my husband, Mike. We also have 2 dogs and a
          cat that keep us occupied. We are a pretty active, social bunch who enjoy the outdoors and our social time
          with family and friends. I also like to be outside getting in as many runs as I can, and mountain biking is at
          the top of my list of fun things to do.
