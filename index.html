          <p>
            When we experience grief, loss, trauma or stress in our lives, it is
            normal for things to unravel. My passion is helping people who have
            experienced a traumatic/stressful experience, those who are
            grieving, and those who are impacted by mental health challenges or
            disorders. Many people find that talking with a safe, confidential
            person, who can listen in a non-judgmental manner can be very
            beneficial. My clients are children, adolescents, adults and
            families.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have an inclusive approach in my counselling practice, including a
            culturally sensitive practice based on individual circumstances. I
            also practice with recognition, respect, and acknowledgement of the
            unique history, culture and traditions of Aboriginal people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also strongly influenced by my work with women and children who
            have been impacted by violence, and the significant need for
            increased awareness of the impact violence has on individuals, our
            children and community.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work is also influenced through my experience working in our
            school system. I was privileged to work as a mental health
            counsellor in our school district, and I learned a great deal about
            the importance of the well being of the school environment. My
            background also includes work as a mental health clinician with
            adults, children and youth.
          </p>

          <p>
            I offer workshops and consultation for grief and loss and mental
            health. My services are covered by some extended health programs and
            employee assistance programs, and I am a registered service provider
            for the Crime Victim Assistance Program (CVAP).
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a client centered approach, and believe that my clients are
            the experts of their own lives. My role is to help support my
            clients through their own journey. Everyone has individual needs and
            approaches to how they approach life challenges. My theoretical
            influences include:

          <p>
            I was born and raised in Salmon Arm, and I grew up helping out in my
            family’s funeral home. My experience at the funeral home influenced
            me to pursue a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Psychology. I have
            stayed active at
            <a href="http://www.bowersfuneralservice.com"
              >Bowers Funeral Home</a
            >
            as a licenced funeral director and a certified funeral celebrant.
            Grief and loss has always been a part of life that I have been drawn
            to learn more about, as grief underlies so many aspects of the
            challenges we face.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am happy to be back in Salmon Arm with my husband, raising our 2
            amazing kids and hanging out with our yellow lab, Henry and our cat,
            Smitty. We are a pretty active, social bunch. We like to hang out
            with our amazing family and friends, and have a lot of good laughs.
            I also like to get as many runs in as I can, and mountain biking is
            at the top of my list of fun things to do.
